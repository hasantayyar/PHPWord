PHPWord
=======

PHP Word is a library designed to generate open office xml (docx) documents. The project 
was originally started by raw_venture_ad on CodePlex but has been inactive since mid 2011. 
I have been patching and extending the functionality of PHPWord and needed a place to fork 
the project since it was not maintained in version control on CodePlex.

Installation
============
Clone this repository and add the library folder to your PHP include path.
